# NAMESPACE CLEANLINESS: for environment variables, we should try to keep
# ourselves confined to the namespace `RAT4_TESTSUITE_*'.
# Also, we should use only the namespaces `rat4t_*' and `_ra4t_*' for both
# variables and functions, but here we can do an exception for the sake of
# simplicity (in the case of e.g. PACKAGE_VERSION, RATFOR or F77) and of
# interoperability with testlib.sh (in the case e.g. of GREP, SED, SHELL
# and DIFF_U).
