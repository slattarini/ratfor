# List of blackbox tests from the Ratfor Testsuite subpackage which are
# expected to fail with C Ratfor.
# Blank lines and lines starting with `#' are ignored.

# C Ratfor handling of ratfor comments still has some warts, which make
# this test fail.

# Currently, ratfor output strings with the same quoting they are input
# with; this should be changed, and only single-quoted strings (e.g. 'foo')
# should be outputted.

# Errors about switch/case are correctly recognized, but can sometimes still
# produce bogus diagnostic messages.

# Automatic line continuation still doesn't work for some operators and for
# relational operators (`&&', `<=', `||' etc.)
line-continuation-automatic-relationals-raw.test

# Due to the way C Ratfor performs translation of relational shorthands,
# error messages involving them might sometimes result slighty botched and
# unclear, so these tests won't pass.
