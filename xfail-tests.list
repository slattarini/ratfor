# List of blackbox tests from the Ratfor Testsuite subpackage which are
# expected to fail with C Ratfor.
# Blank lines and lines starting with `#' are ignored.

# Currently, ratfor output strings with the same quoting they are input
# with; this should be changed, and only single-quoted strings (e.g. 'foo')
# should be outputted.

# The `%'-escaping is now implemented correctly, but due the "suboptimal"
# (i.e. crappy) implementation of relation shortands' translation, the
# following tests still fail.

# Automatic line continuation still doesn't work for some operators and for
# relational operators (`&&', `<=', `||' etc.)

# Due to the way C Ratfor performs translation of relational shorthands,
# error messages involving them might sometimes result slighty botched and
# unclear, so these tests won't pass.

# C Rafor still fails to recognize quoted file names in the `include'
# builtin.

# The recent changes in parser have revealed a limitation in the code
# generation subroutines of C Ratfor, which causes this test to fail.
# Once we'll have fixed those limitations, this test should pass again,
# but for the moment it's simpler to mark it as xfailing.
