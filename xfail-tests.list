# List of blackbox tests from the Ratfor Testsuite subpackage which are
# expected to fail with C Ratfor.
# Blank lines and lines starting with `#' are ignored.

# Currently, ratfor output strings with the same quoting they are input
# with; this should be changed, and only single-quoted strings (e.g. 'foo')
# should be outputted.

# The `%'-escaping is now implemented correctly, but due the "suboptimal"
# (i.e. crappy) implementation of relation shortands' translation, the
# following tests still fail.

# Automatic line continuation still doesn't work for some operators and for
# relational operators (`&&', `<=', `||' etc.)

# Due to the way C Ratfor performs translation of relational shorthands,
# error messages involving them might sometimes result slighty botched and
# unclear, so these tests won't pass.

# Currently, C Rafor process `define' and `include' builtins also in the
# middle of a statement, which makes the following tests fail.  This is
# not a good behaviour, and will hopefully be fixed in a future release.
