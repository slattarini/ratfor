	Tiny refactoring in testsuite's shell libraries
	We do some rafactorings and modifications to the testsuite's shell
	libraries, to make their reuse by part of client packages easier.

	* lib/rat4-testlib.sh: Minor typofix in comment.
	Added a heading comment telling that this file must be included
	after testlib.sh.
	(print_testrun_info): New subroutine.
	* lib/rat4-t.in: Use it.

	ChangeLog generation moved to maint-only (SteLib helped here)
	* maint/git-generate-changelog.mk: New file from SteLib, defining
	rules/targets to generate ChangeLog file from Git commit messages.
	* maint/prj-post-cfg.mk: Include it.
	(changelog-start-date): New variable. Commits before the date defined
	here are not put in the ChangeLog.
	* Makefile.am: Remove ChangeLog generation. Details follow...
	(gen_start_date): Variable removed.
	($(srcdir)/ChangeLog): Target removed.
	(force-changelog-gen): Likewise.
	(MOSTLYCLEANFILES): Don't extend with `ChangeLog.tmp'.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Don't extend with `$(srcdir)/ChangeLog'.

	Revert "Generating ChangeLog don't break distcheck anymore"
	This reverts commit 69c713e646ebe679468cccf33bd0f168ccd3ed03.
	The modified changelog generation worked only in subdirs of the
	directory containing the `.git' administrative directory, so
	it worked for "make distcheck", but was broken in distributed
	tarballs. Sigh. Thus we are going to require a deeper change.

	* build-aux/move-if-change: Deleted.
	* Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/ChangeLog): Use `mv -f', not
	`build-aux/move-if-change'.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Removed `build-aux/move-if-change'.

	Generating ChangeLog don't break distcheck anymore
	* build-aux/move-if-change: New script from Gnulib.
	* Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/ChangeLog): Update the file only if it
	changed from the last version, by using the new `move-if-change'
	auxiliary script.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add `build-aux/move-if-change'.

	renaming: CheckTestsList.am => CheckListOfTests.am
	* lib/CheckTestsList.am: Deleted, renamed to ...
	* lib/CheckListOfTests.am: ... this new file.
	* sanity-checks/Makefile.am: Adjusted accordingly.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Likewise.

2009-12-26  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	cosmetic changes in Makefiles.am (comments)
	* sanity-checks/Makefile.am: Make some comments less lurid, while
	leaving them still eye-catching enough. Make some other comments
	clearer.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Likewise.

	Make generated ChangeLog readonly
	* Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/ChangeLog): Make generated Changelog readonly.

2009-12-24  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	new target maintainer-check (check list of tests moved there)
	* Makefile.am (maintainer-check-list-of-tests): New target,
	delegating to the equally-named target in `tests/Makefile.am'.
	(maintainer-check): New target.  Depends from the just-described
	new target `maintainer-check-list-of-tests'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (check-local): It doesn't depend anymore on
	`check-list-of-tests'. Thus removed, as it's not useful anymore.
	(ALL_TESTS): Deleted, no more needed.  Use $(TESTS) directly.
	(TESTS): Directly define to the list of test scripts.
	* sanity-check/Makefile.am: Likewise.
	* lib/CheckTestsList.am: Updated from SteLib.
	(check-list-of-tests): Target deleted, renamed to ...
	(maintainer-check-list-of-tests): ... this.
	It now checks the contents of the `$(TESTS)' variable, not of the
	`$(ALL_TESTS)' variable.
	It consider also the test scripts in `$(builddir)', not only
	those in `$(srcdir)' (this can account for generated test scripts).
	It does not require anymore the definition of the $(DIFF_U)
	variable.
	Finally, the verbosity of the target has been decreased.

	Require autoconf 2.64
	* configure.ac (AC_PREREQ): Require autoconf version 2.64, instead
	of just version 2.62.

2009-12-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Force unconditional regeneration of ChangeLog
	* Makefile.am (forche-changelog-gen): New phony empty target.
	($(srcdir)/ChangeLog): Depend on it.

	Typofix in HACKING
	* HACKING (Recording changes): Fixed typo(s):
	    s/`Changelog target/`ChangeLog' target/

2009-12-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Generate ChangeLog in $(srcdir), not in $(builddir)
	* Makefile.am (ChangeLog): Generate ChangeLog file in $(srcdir),
	not in $(builddir). This also fixes a failure in `make distcheck'.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): List `$(srcdir)/ChangeLog', not simply
	`ChangeLog'.

	Generation of ChangeLog do not require maint-rules
	* Makefile.am (ChangeLog): This rule is now inconditional (previosuly
	it was considered only when the `ENABLE_MAINTAINER_MAKE_RULES' Automake
	conditional was true).
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Likewise, addition of `ChangeLog' is now
	unconditional.
	(MOSTLYCLEANFILES): Likewise, addition of `ChangeLog.tmp' is now
	unconditional.

2009-12-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Remove AC_SUBST vars $build_aux and $abs_build_aux
	configure.ac: Remove AC_SUBST'd variables `$build_aux' and
	`$abs_build_aux': they were redundant, and in fact never used.

2009-12-19  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Bugfix: distribute aux script `git-version-gen'
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add `build-aux/git-version-gen'.

	Added automatic generation of ChangeLog file.
	* build-aux/gitlog-to-changelog: New file, from gnulib (with minor
	modifications).  It's meant to generate a ChangeLog file from git
	log messages.
	* Changelog-old: New file.  Contains older changelog entries.
	* Makefile.am (ChangeLog): New rule: generate a ChangeLog file
	from git log messages.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Added `build-aux/gitlog-to-changelog', `ChangeLog'
	and `Changelog-old'.
	(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Added `ChangeLog'.
	* .gitignore: Added ChangeLog.
	* HACKING: Tell that the ChangeLog is automatically generated.

2009-12-02  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Refactoring: testcases made more decoupled (plus some minor fixings)
	* tests/*.test: Use `testcase_FAIL', not `testcase_FATAL_FAILURE', so
	that a failed testcase does not abort the whole test script.  Minor
	changes related to this one.  Minor various improvements & fixings to
	some test scripts (esp, improved verbose messages, or sometimes
	comments/descriptions).  A couple of bug fixings (e.g. grep of the
	wrong file, forgotten `|| testcase_FAIL' after a tested command, and
	other similar absent-minded mistakes).

2009-12-03  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Bugfix in test `startlabel-default.test'
	* tests/startlabel-default.test (call to `$EGREP -v'): Bugfix: we
	forgot to put the file to grep on the command line:
	  (-) old command:  $EGREP -v '...' && TESTCASE-FAILURE
	  (+) new command:  $EGREP -v '...' FILE && TESTCASE-FAILURE
	It's important to note that the old call to egrep always failed, since
	we close standard input of test scripts in `testlib.sh'; thus we could
	have a false negative in this test script (BAD!)

2009-12-02  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Refactor (sanity checks): testcases more decoupled
	* sanity-checks/run_F77.test: use `testcase_FAIL', not
	`testcase_FATAL_FAILURE', so that a failed testcase does
	not abort the whole test script.
	* sanity-checks/run_RATFOR.test: Likewise.
	* sanity-checks/run_command.test: Likewise.
	* sanity-checks/timer-cc.test: Likewise.
	* sanity-checks/timer.test: Likewise.

	Updated testlib.sh from Stelib (fixes in exit trap)
	* lib/stelib.sh: Updated with a new version from SteLib: minor bug
	fixes and improvements in handling of exit trap and exit cleanup.

	`MostlyCleanConfigureTmp.am' moved in `lib/' (mostly for consistency)
	* MostlyCleanConfigureTmp.am: Removed (mostly for consistency/cosmetic
	reasons, as tho other *.am fragments are in all in `lib/' directory);
	moved to this ...
	* lib/MostlyCleanConfigureTmp.am: ... new file.
	* Makefile.am: include directive regarding `MostlyCleanConfigureTmp.am'
	updated accordingly.

	Refactor testsuite: make testcases more decoupled
	* tests/subprog-name-invalid.sh: Use `testcase_FAIL' instead of
	ad-hoc code to signal failures.
	(testcase_done): Function removed, it's no more needed.
	* tests/function-name-invalid-1.test: Use function `testcase_DONE'

2009-11-16  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Typofix in README
	* README: Typofix: s/fo/of/.

	README: update refs/samples w.r.t. "C Ratfor" package
	* README: Since the `C Ratfor' package recently changed its way to
	use and import the `Ratfor Testsuite' supackage (by departing from
	the simple recommended way described in this `README'), we updated
	references and examples referring to `C Ratfor' by explicitly
	telling that they are indeed referred to and "older version" of
	`C Ratfor'.

	Reorganizing (new dir sanity-checks/)
	The new directory `sanity-checks', containing test scripts doing
	sanity check on the testsuite itself (previosly these where in
	`tests/SanityChecks/').

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Added `sanity-checks/'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Removed `SanityChecks/'.
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): added `sanity-checks/Makefile',
	removed `tests/SanityChecks/Makefile'.
	* tests/SanityChecks/Makefile.am: Removed, moved to ...
	* sanity-checks/Makefile.am: ... this. Also, fixed relative
	includes of `lib/*.am' files.
	* tests/SanityChecks/timer.test: Removed, moved to...
	* sanity-checks/timer.test: ... this. Also, fixed sourcing of
	`lib/rat4-t.sh' file.
	* tests/SanityChecks/timer-cc.test: Removed, moved to...
	* sanity-checks/timer-cc.test: ... this. Also, fixed sourcing of
	`lib/rat4-t.sh' file.
	* tests/SanityChecks/run_command.test: Removed, moved to...
	* sanity-checks/run_command.test: ... this. Also, fixed sourcing of
	`lib/rat4-t.sh' file.
	* tests/SanityChecks/run_RATFOR.test: Removed, moved to...
	* sanity-checks/run_RATFOR.test: ... this. Also, fixed sourcing of
	`lib/rat4-t.sh' file.
	* tests/SanityChecks/run_F77.test: Removed, moved to...
	* sanity-checks/run_F77.test: ... this. Also, fixed sourcing of
	`lib/rat4-t.sh' file.

	Reorganizing (new dir lib/): move makefile fragments
	The new directory `lib' will contain all auxiliary files used by
	the testsuite.  In this commit, we move there shell scripts
	fragments (which are included by test scripts), shared data files
	and auxiliary/wrapper scripts.

	* tests/TestsAux/rat4-t.in: Removed, moved to...
	* lib/rat4-t.in: ... this.
	($testaux_srcdir): Definition updated.
	($testaux_builddir): Likewise
	* tests/TestsAux/rat4-testlib.sh: Removed, moved to...
	* lib/rat4-testlib.sh: ... this.
	($testaux_srcdir): Removed redundant definition.
	($testaux_builddir): Likewise.
	* tests/TestsAux/rat4-t.in: Removed, moved to...
	* lib/rat4-t.in: ... this.
	* tests/TestsAux/.gitignore: Removed, moved to...
	* lib/.gitignore: ... this.
	* lib/Makefile.am: New file. It help us to add contents of
	lib/ to $(EXTRA_DIST) and/or properly extended $(check_DATA),
	$(check_SCRIPTS), etc.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Added `lib'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Removed `TestsAux'.
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Updated accordingly to the
	various movings/renamings.
	* HACKING (Section "Writing Test Cases", subsection "Do"):
	Bugfix: tell to  include `../lib/rat4-t.sh', not `./TestsAux/defs.sh',
	in every test script. Also, other references to `TestsAux/defs.{in,sh}'
	modified to refer to `lib/rat4-t.{in,sh}' instead.
	(Section "Writing Test Cases", subsection "Do Not"): Bugfix:
	tell that `run_command' is defined in `lib/testlib.sh', not
	that it's defined in `tests/TestsAux/defs.in'.
	* tests/subprog-name-invalid.sh: Cite `rat4-t.sh', not
	`TestsAux/defs.sh'.
	* tests/SanityChecks/run_F77.test: Line with code sourcing
	`rat4-t.sh' has been modified to account for the relocation
	of `rat4-t.in'.

	Reorganizing (new dir lib/): move makefile fragments
	The new directory `lib', will contain all auxiliary files used by
	the testsuite.  In this commit, we move there Makefile fragments.

	* tests/CheckTestsList.am: Removed, moved to ...
	* lib/CheckTestsList.am: ... this.
	* tests/LocalCleanup.am: Removed, moved to...
	* lib/LocalCleanup.am: ... this.
	* tests/TestsEnvironment.am: Removed, moved to...
	* lib/TestsEnvironment.am: ... this.
	* tests/Makefile.am (include): Updated accordingly.
	* tests/SanityChecks/Makefile.am (include): Likewise.

	Bugfix in tests/SanityChecks/Makefile.am
	* tests/SanityChecks/Makefile.am: Removed the definition
	`$(XFAIL_TESTS) = $(RAT4_TESTSUITE_XFAIL_TESTS)'.  It was just
	cruft left when we did cut&paste from `tests/Makefile.am'.

	Separated test `switch-fail.test' in two test scripts
	* tests/switch-fail.test: Removed, separated into two new scripts...
	* tests/switch-fail-case-label-duplicated.test: ... this new script ...
	* tests/switch-fail-case-label-invalid.test: ... and this new script.
	* tests/Makefile.am (ALL_TESTS): Updated accordingly.

	Fixed/relaxed test `switch-fail.test'
	* tests/switch-fail.test: Removed part of the test, as that is now
	covered by the newly-added test `illegal-case-default.test'

	Git commit messages follow GNU Coding Standards
	* HACKING (Recording changes): Tell the git commit messages should
	follow the GNU Coding Standards for ChangeLog entries.  Minor related
	reordering of items.
