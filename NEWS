List of user-visible changes of Public Domain Ratfor.

New in 1.0k
-----------
 * The ratfor testsuite, which is composed only of blackbox-style test
   scripts, is now a subpackage, with its own configure script, makefiles,
   auto* auxiliary files etcetera.  It has been moved from the `tests/'
   subdirectory into the `blackbox-tests/' subdirectory.

New in 1.0j
-----------
 * Since Fortran 77 is ubiquitous today, and Fortran 66 almost forgotten,
   Ratfor now output Fortran 77 code, without bothering anymore about
   Fortran 66 compatibility.
 * The `string' directive is no more recognized.  It should be superseded
   by the improved string-handling capabilities of Fortran 77.
 * The handling of the `-o' has been improved; in particular
    - error messages are more detailed;
    - `-o -' sends output to standard output;
    - files are no more unnecessarily overwritten if multiple `-o'
      options are specified (only the last one is honoured).
 * The error messages have been generally improved and made more detailed.
   A prominent example of this improvement is the increased level of
   details in messages about I/O failures, with the explicit indication of
   the failure's reason, e.g. `No such file or directory' or `Permission
   denied'.
 * Now ratfor complains if given more than one non-option arguments,
   instead of silently discarding all the extra arguments.
 * Messages about usage errors involving unknown option or options called
   in the wrong way have now the format:
    <PROGNAME>: `-<OPTION>': <ERROR-MESSAGE>
 * Now the `configure' scripts tries by defaults to enable as many warnings
   as possible in the C compiler.  Currently, there is no way to disable
   this behaviour.
 * There is a new configure option, `--enable-werror-flags', which tries
   to enable the `-Werror' compiler flag (if the compiler supports itd), to
   turn compile-time warnings into errors.  This option is expected to be
   used mostly by maintainers.
 * Previously, if the user used GNU make, maintainer-specific make rules
   were uncoditionally imported by the GNUmakefile.  Now the user must pass
   the option `--enable-maintainer-make-rules' to configure to enable the
   importing of such rules.  This option is expected to be used only by
   maintainers.
 * Now, even if using GNU make, a `make' command issued in an unconfigured
   tree does not anymore trigger autotools boostrapping (i.e. basically the
   call of `autoreconf', `./configure' and `make all').
 * It should now be possible to compile Ratfor also with a C++ compiler.

New in 1.0i
-----------

 * Ratfor is now fully case-sensible, both respect to its input and to its
   output.  In particular, this means that output is no more converted to
   lowercase (this conversion was tricky, since e.g. strings and comments
   had to be left unchanged, and was cause of some bugs and dark corner
   cases).  This new behaviour shouldn't cause problems, as modern fortran
   compilers, although case-insensible, are smart enough not to barf on
   mixed-case input.
 * The line numbers in error messages should now be always correct, even
   when inclusion of files or expansion of macros are involved.  Alas,
   this was not the case before.
 * An input line starting with `%' is always passed *truly* verbatim to
   output, without line wrapping (if the user wants to output raw fortran
   code, we expect him to know what he's doing, so we must be as
   unobtrusive as possible).  Previously, even the `%'-quoted lines were
   subjected to line wrapping, so that they did not exceed the maximum
   line lenght allowed in valid fortran code.
 * Now an underscore character `_' at the end of a line do continuation
   *only* for the next newline character, while previously it did line
   continuation up to the first non-empty line found.
   For example, with the new behaviour, the input:
     foo_

     bar
   has an output similar to:
     foo
     bar
   while with the old behaviour it had an output similar to:
     foobar
 * Tabs in input are always converted to single spaces in output, even in
   generated fortran comments.
 * If GNU make is called on the unconfigured ratfor tree, it automatically
   runs autoreconf and ./configure before trying to build the given
   targets.
 * Testuite coverage increased, with many new test scripts added.
 * Added the customary installation instruction (in file `INSTALL').

New in 1.0h
-----------

 * Extended make rules useful to maintainers, in particular with the
   addition of files `GNUmakefile' and `maint.mk'
 * Now the user can explicitly tell configure that he doesn't have (or
   doesn't want to use) a Fortran 77 compiler for the testsuite.
   This is done by setting the configure variable `RAT4_TESTSUITE_F77'
   to `NONE'.

New in 1.0g
-----------

 * The make target `clean' should now work correctly even an a already
   cleaned tree (previously it could fail if no temporary directory used
   by test scripts was present!)
 * Ratfor uses Git as its version control system.

New in 1.0f
-----------

 * The format of error messages has been improved -- now it follows the
   gcc-style `FILENAME:LINENO: ERRMSG'
 * Bugfix in option parsing: the option `-l' is now recognized again
 * The make targets `distcheck' and `clean' should now work.
 * The make target `check' now let the user override the variable
   `$(TESTS)' withour problems
 * The list of known bugs has been extended and improved.
 * The ratfor binary used by the testsuite is now correctly rebuild
   when needed, even from within the `tests' directory
 * The ratfor source code has been modularized and cleaned somewhat.

New in 1.0e
-----------

 * On non-fatal syntax errors in input, a proper error message is displayed
   on standard error, but input processing is not stopped (this was also
   the previous behaviour).  However, if any syntax error occourred, ratfor
   is now guaranteed to eventually exit with  exit status `1' (previously
   it exited with exit status `0').
 * Ratfor does not more force quoted filenames for `include' to work.
 * Unfortunately, Ratfor does not more even accept quoted filenames passed
   to `include'.  Hopefully this will be fixed in a future release.
 * The testsuite now uses only one Fortran 77 compiler, not a list of them.
   The user can override the Fortran compiler automatically detected by
   configure using the variable `RAT4_TESTSUITE_F77' (previously the
   variable `RAT4_TESTSUITE_F77_LIST' was to be used instead).
 * The user can now override the `TESTS_ENVIRONMENT' variable when doing
   `make check'.
 * The environmental variables which can influence the ratfor testsuite are
   now all placed in the namespace `RAT4_TESTSUITE_*'

New in 1.0d
-----------

 * Ratfor build system now uses automake and autoconf.
 * Added an article of B.W. Kernighan on ratfor (doc/ratfor.pdf).
 * Added a testsuite.
 * Added this NEWS file.
 * Ratfor uses Subversion as its version control system.
