List of user-visible changes of Public Domain Ratfor.

New in 1.0e
-----------
 
 * On non-fatal syntax errors in input, a proper error message is
   displayed on standard error, but input processing is not stopped
   (this was also the previous behaviour).  However, if any syntax
   error occourred, ratfor is now guaranteed to eventually exit with
   exit status `1' (previously it exited with exit status `0').
 * Ratfor does not more force quoted filenames for `include' to work.
 * Unfortunately, Ratfor does not more even accept quoted filenames
   passed to `include'.  Hopefully this will be fixed in a future
   release.

New in 1.0d
-----------
 
 * Ratfor build system now uses automake and autoconf.
 * Added an article of B.W. Kernighan on ratfor (doc/ratfor.pdf).
 * Added a testsuite.
 * Added this NEWS file.
 * Ratfor uses Subversion as its version control system.
