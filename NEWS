List of user-visible changes of Ratfor Testsuite.

New in XXX
-----------
 * We don't ship a ChangeLog file anymore.  The ChangeLog was generated
   from git history anyway, so nothing is lost with this decision.

New in 0.9i
-----------
 * The rules creating the generated test script should now work portably.
 * Extended tests on `break' and `next' keywords, esp. by checking that
   they work as advised when the optional integer argument is present.
 * Added tests checking that nested "for", "while" and "switch" statements
   work as expected.
 * Added tests checking that ratfor comments are not terminated by
   semicolons or right curly brackets.
 * Much better and more extensive tests on the "repeat/until" statement.
 * Added tests checking that ratfor statements with empty bodies (e.g.
   "if(cond);" or "while(cond){}") work as expected.
 * Added tests checking that ratfor correctly complains when parentheses
   are missing after keywords that require them (e.g. "if" and "until").
 * Added tests checking that the `break' and `next' ratfor keywords are
   recognized and processed when placed after a numerical label, and are
   not recognized/processed when placed in the middle of a statement (we
   should have added this checks previously, but they were forgotten out,
   somehow).
 * In test scripts: ensure that no shell builtin is run where an external
   command is expected.  This fixes a weird bug occurring when a Fortran
   compiler named `fc' was used, as it could collide with the `fc' builtin
   on Korn shells.
 * Fixed a couple of minor bugs in test scripts and data files.
 * Fixed spurious failures w.r.t. some shells, as Almquist Shell and Bash
   2.0.

New in 0.9h
-----------
 * Added and extended tests regarding Ratfor keywords.  In particular,
   there are tests checking that (most of) those keywords (e.g. `while',
   `for', `if') are recognized and processed when placed after a numerical
   label, and are on the contrary not recognized/processed when placed in
   the middle of a statement.
 * Added and extended tests regarding the `define' and `include' builtins,
   the handling of Ratfor comments, and the `%' verbatim escaping.  In
   particular, there are now test checking that the `define' and `include'
   builtins and the `%' escaping construct are processed only when placed
   at the beginning of a statement.
 * The Ratfor Testsuite is now explicitly covered by the GNU General
   Public License, version 3 or later.
 * The shell libraries used by the test scripts has been made more
   namespace-clean.  This can enhance their usefulness and solidity
   for usage by client packages.

New in 0.9g
-----------
 * The testsuite has been improved and strenghtened.  Especially notable
   is the fact that now different testcases in a same test script are
   (mostly) decoupled.  In particular, a test script does not stop at the
   first failed testcase, but run all the testcases and report all those
   which failed.
 * Now a ChangeLog file is distributed, being automatically generated
   from Git commit messages.

New in 0.9f
-----------
 * Fixed a bug which prevented the tests scripts to work with Heirloom Sh
   and/or Solaris Sh.
 * Silent rules in the Makefiles are not enabled by default anymore.
 * With Zsh version 4.x or later, it's now possible to run the test scripts
   with just e.g. `zsh foo.test', without needing to use the Zsh option
   `-o no_function_argzero'.
 * When specifying to configure the list of test scripts expected to fail
   (through the variable `RAT4_TESTUITE_XFAIL_TESTS'), it's now possible
   to simply use test basenames rather than test fullnames (e.g. `foo'
   raher than `foo.tests').  This shortcut should have been supported also
   previosuly, but didn't worked in practice due to a bug in configure.

New in 0.9e
-----------
 * Now the testsuite should work also with mksh (the MirBSD Korn Shell) on
   Linux systems (previously a bug in the interaction between the GNU C
   Library and mksh prevented this).

New in 0.9d
-----------
 * Now the user can define, at configure time, a list of test cases
   expected to fail (see variable `RAT4_TESTUITE_XFAIL_TESTS').
 * The Ratfor Testsuite have been fixed to work also with gfortran
   version 4.0.  Previously it didn't work because of a misbehaviour in
   gfortran-4.0 which caused the `STOP' builtin in the compiled programs
   to be too much verbose.

New in 0.9c
-----------
 * Fixed a bug in the auxiliary script `timer', which could cause spurious
   intermittent failures with some Korn shells.

New in 0.9b
-----------
 * Now the `configure' scripts checks that the detected Fortran 77
   compiler can create executables (this was not done before).  The check
   is performed even if the compiler is specified by the user himself
   (through the `F77' variable).  The only exception is when F77 is
   defined as "NONE", meaning that no Fortran compiler is to be used by
   the testsuite (this special behaviour was present also in the previous
   versions).
 * Auxiliary program `timer' (used by the testsuite) has been rewritten
   as a shell script, so that no C compiler is required anymore to run
   the Ratfor Testsuite.
 * Added possibility to import mainter-specific rules when using GNU Make,
   if the (new) option `--enable-maintainer' is passed to the configure
   script.
 * The Ratfor Testsuite uses files imported from SteLib (e.g. `maint.mk',
   `GNUmakefile', and `ax_check_cc_flag.m4').  Some related reorganization
   and modifications have been required.
 * Added BUGS and HACKING files.  Consequent adaptation of the README file.

New in 0.9a
-----------
 * The Ratfor Testsuite tree has been separated from the Public Domain
   Ratfor tree, and turned into an indipendent package, beginning a life
   of its own.
