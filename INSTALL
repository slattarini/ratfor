The "Ratfot Testsuite" is not meant to be installed.

It can simply be used directly from its own tree to check an installed
version of the ratfor properocessor.

Alternatively, it can be embedded in the distribution of a third-party
ratfor processor to work as its testsuite, or at least as a part of its
testsuite.
