This is the TODO file for C Ratfor.

 * Support option `-I' to look for included files.

 * Add `ifdef', `ifndef', `endif' and `undef'.

 * Cleanup and improvements of the parser.

 * Modify the semantic of the `-C' option: `#' comments  should be kept
   only if they appear at the beginning of a statement.  This is probably
   best done by changing the parser so that it recognizes the `#' as a
   special kind of statement.

 * Re-add support for `string' ratfor statement.
