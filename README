README file for Public Domain Raftor.
$Id$

    This is a C version of ratfor, derived from a UofA ratfor
    in ratfor. It was originally released to the net sometime
    ago, and it is re-released for the benefit of those sites
    who only get mod->comp.sources.

    It now includes minor changes to produce F77 code as well.

    This code *is* released in the public domain PD. See the file
    COPYING for more information.

    I would, as usual, appreciate hearing about bug fixes and
    improvements.
