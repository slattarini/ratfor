	This is a C version of ratfor, derived from a UofA ratfor
	in ratfor. It was originally released to the net sometime
	ago, and It is re-released for the benefit of those sites
	who only get mod->comp.sources.

	It now includes minor changes to produce F77 code as well.

	This code *is* released in the public domain PD. See the file
    COPYING for more information.

	I would, as usual, appreciate hearing about bug fixes and
	improvements.
