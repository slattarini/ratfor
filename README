README file for the C Raftor distribution.


What is C Ratfor
----------------

 C Ratfor is a ratfor preprocessor written in C.  It translates programs
 written in the ratfor language into Fortran 77 programs.

 C Ratfor is derived from Public Domain Ratfor, which in turn derived from
 a ratfor proprocessor written at the University of Arizona's (which, by
 the way, was implemented in ratfor itself).  For those interested, the
 latest released version of Public Domain Ratfor can be downloaded from:
   <http://sepwww.stanford.edu/doku.php?id=sep:software:ratfor>

 For further information about the Ratfor language, its documentation, and
 other existing implementations of Ratfor preprocessors, refer to the C
 Ratfor man page in the `doc/' subdirectory.


Building and Installing C Ratfor
---------------------------------

 C Ratfor provides a Autotools-based build system, so it should support
 "out of the box" almost all the GNU standards for build systems.  For
 more detailed information, read the `INSTALL' file.


Testing C Ratfor
----------------

 The C Ratfor testsuite is described in the file `tests/README'.  Refer
 to that file for more information about how to run or extend the C Ratfor
 testsuite.
