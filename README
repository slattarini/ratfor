README file for the C Ratfor distribution.

*** FIXME ***
The build system of this package is broken and badly bit-rotten.  Hopefully
I'll find some time and will to fix it (at least to the point where the
package actually builds).

What is C Ratfor
----------------

C Ratfor is a ratfor preprocessor written in C.  It translates programs
written in the ratfor language into Fortran 77 programs.

C Ratfor is derived from Public Domain Ratfor, which in turn derived from
a ratfor preprocessor written at the University of Arizona's (which, by
the way, was implemented in ratfor itself).  For those interested, the
latest released version of Public Domain Ratfor can be downloaded from:
  <http://sepwww.stanford.edu/doku.php?id=sep:software:ratfor>

For further information about the Ratfor language, its documentation, and
other existing implementations of Ratfor preprocessors, refer to the C
Ratfor man page in the `doc/' subdirectory.


Building and Installing C Ratfor
---------------------------------

The C Ratfor build system uses GNU Autotools, and thus it is mostly
compliant with GNU standards.  For a detailed description of C Ratfor's
configuration and installation process, read the `INSTALL' file.


Testing C Ratfor
----------------

The C Ratfor testsuite is described in the file `tests/README'.  Refer
to that file for more information about how to run or extend the C Ratfor
testsuite.
