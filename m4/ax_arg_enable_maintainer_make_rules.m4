# AX_ARG_ENABLE_MAINTAINER_MAKE_RULES
# -----------------------------------
# Enable maintainer-specific make rules, on user request through the option
# `--enable-maintainer-make-rules'.
# For this macro to be used meaningfully, the package developer must setup
# proper maintainer-specific rules by itself, to be placed in a GNUmakefile
# wrapping the package's top-level Makefile, and to be actived only when
# the Automake conditional `ENABLE_MAINTAINER_MAKE_RULES' is set to "true".
