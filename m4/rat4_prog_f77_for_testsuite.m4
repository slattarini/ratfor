# Find a Fortran 77 compiler, to be used in testing.
# First look for a user-provided compiler (expected to be found in variable
# `RAT4_TESTSUITE_F77'), else search the system for a valid and working
# Fortran 77 compiler, using the `AC_PROG_F77' macro.
# Put the detected compiler in `RAT4_TESTSUITE_F77' (set this empty if no
# compiler was found), and declare it as a "precious" variable (so that in
# particular it is automatically AC_SUBST'd).
