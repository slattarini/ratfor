# Check that the `define' builtin, when used in the form `define(x, ...)',
# preserve comments.  This test carefully avoid to use relation shortands
# (as `==', `<' or `&&') in comments, since some ratfor preprocessors out
# there (e.g. older versions of C Ratfor) handle them in a clumsy way,
# which would make the present test fail spuriously if they were used in
# ratfor comments.
