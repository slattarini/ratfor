# Explicitly set the $srcdir variable for the test cases.
#  (Q.1) Why do we need this definition?
#  (A.1) So that the code in defs.sh won't be forced to calculate it
#        again and again.
#  (Q.2) Why we can't rely on automake feature of exporting
#       `srcdir=$(srcdir)' in the environment of every test case?
#  (A.2) We prefer to export `srcdir=$(abs_srcdir)' instead, since
#        otherwise, whenever $(srcdir) is not an absolute path (which
#        is the usual case), defs.sh will be forced to make it an
#        absolute path (with e.g. srcdir=`pwd`/$srcdir), thereby
#        slowing the execution of the testsuite.
