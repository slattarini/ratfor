This is the README file for the testsuite of C Ratfor preprocessor.

The directory `graybox' contains "graybox-style" test scripts tailored to
this implementation of Ratfor.  These tests are tailored to the limits,
weak spots and previous bugs of "C Ratfor" (so they should provide also
regression testing).

The directory `blackbox' contains a copy of the package "The Ratfor
Testuite", providing black-box tests for a generic Ratfor implementation.
Refer to file `blackbox/README' for more information.
