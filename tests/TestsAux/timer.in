# timer -- Run a command in the given time, abort it if times out.
#          Part of The Ratfor Testsuite
#
# Usage: timer [-t TIME] COMMAND [ARGS]
#
# Run the given COMMAND, until the given TIME (measured in seconds) is
# expired, then terminate it.
# COMMAND can be an absolute path, a relative path or a command name; in
# this last case, a PATH search is performed.
# If TIME is not specified, it defaults to 10 seconds.
# Return status of `timer' is 99 on usage errors, 127 if COMMAND was not
# found, 126 if COMMAND was not executable, 128+SIGNUM if COMAMND was
# terminated by signal number SIGNUM, 254 if COMMAND timed out, 255 on
# unexpected errors (e.g. failures in fork()), and the return status of
# COMMAND otherwise.
