This is the TODO file for C Ratfor.

 * Support option `-I' to look for included files.

 * Add `ifdef', `ifndef', `endif' and `undef'.

 * Cleanup and improvements of the parser:
    - Recognize the `%' escaping only at the beggining of a statement;
      do this by recognizing `%' in the parser.
    - Integrate `define', `ifdef', `ifndef', `endif' and `undef' in the
      parser.
    - Probably there's room for other changes and improvements.

 * Modify the semantic of the `-C' option: `#' comments  should be kept
   only if they appear at the beginning of a statement.  This is probably
   best done by changing the parser so that it recognizes the `#' as a
   special kind of statement.
