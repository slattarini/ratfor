#  This file is meant to be used by maintainers only; it try to detect
#  which developer is using it (by looking at the output of `id' command)
#  and include the proper *.mk file with  definitions specific to that
#  maintainer.  This inclusion can be skipped by setting the variable
#  `NO_DEVELOPER_PERSONAL_MAKEFILE' to `yes' (either in make or in the
#  environment)
