The sytanx errors seems not to be reported if found inside files included
with the `include' directive. Must be fixed ASAP.

 ---

The `include' stateent coerce the name of the file to include to lowercase.
This crazy on case-senible file-systems. Must be fixed ASAP.

 ---

The `return' keyword being used outside any function defition is not
flagged as an error, so that at the main level a ratfor stament like:
  return 1
is translated to fortran code like:
  =1
  return

 ---

This is not a bug but a design error in both AT&T ratfor
and this public domain ratfor:

The problem is with the switch statment.
It switches on an integer valued expression.
It should switch on an integer variable.

The reason is that
    "implicit undefined"
    "implicit null"
is unusable because the switch is done on a new variable that
is not declared or declarable by the programmer who cannot guess
its name.

Please let me know if you fix this.
