List of BUGS for the Ratfor Testsuite.

 ---

Some test scripts cause the MirBSD Korn Shell on GNU/Linux to crash.
It is not yet clear which versions of the shell or the OS are involved.

 ---

This is a limitation rather than a bug.
The test scripts are already tailored to and designed for the Public Domain
Ratfor.  This will hopefully change when another ratfor version will be
available for testing.
