List of BUGS for the Public Domain Ratfor preprocessor.

 ---

Due to the way public domain ratfor performs translation of relational
shorthands, error messages involving them might sometimes result slighty
botched and unclear.  For example, the following input:
  function &&
produced the diagnostic:
  "invalid function name `.and.'"
instead of the more precise one:
  "invalid function name `&&'"

 ---

This is a limitation rather than a bug.

Defining a symbol (with the `define' builtin) to an expression containing
that same symbol will led to a silent infinite recursion, and ratfor will
hang. An example of this situation:
  define SYM SYM
A more convoluted example:
  define SYM1 SYM2
  define SYM2 SYM3
  define SYM3 SYM1

This is not a bug but a design error in both AT&T ratfor and this
public domain ratfor.

The problem is with the switch statment.
It switches on an integer valued expression.
It should switch on an integer variable.

The reason is that
    "implicit undefined"
    "implicit null"
is unusable because the switch is done on a new variable that
is not declared or declarable by the programmer who cannot guess
its name.

This is a limitation rather than a bug.

Ratfor *absolutely* does not work on non-text input: if feeded such an
input, it might output gibberish, crash or even hang indefinitely (!)
