List of BUGS for the public domain ratfor preprocessor.

 ---

The sytanx errors seems not to be reported if found inside files included
with the `include' directive. Must be fixed ASAP.

 ---

The `include' stateent coerce the name of the file to include to lowercase.
This crazy on case-senible file-systems. Must be fixed ASAP.

 ---

The builtin `define' is case-insensible w.r.t. symbol names, so that a
statement like:
  define SYM "value"
defines both the symbols `SYM' and `sym' to "value"!

  ---

Lines starting with `%' should be copied verbatim to the output (apart
from stripping the `%', of course). But currently they are still subjected
to line wrapping.
  
  ---

This is a limitation rather than a bug.

Defining a symbol (with the `define' builtin) to an expression containing
that same symbol will led to a silent infinite recursion, and ratfor will
hang. An example of this situation:
  define SYM SYM
A more convoluted example:
  define SYM1 SYM2
  define SYM2 SYM3
  define SYM3 SYM1
 
 ---

This is a limitation rather than a bug.

The `return' keyword being used outside any function defition is not
flagged as an error, so that at the main level a ratfor stament like:
  return 1
is translated to fortran code like:
  =1
  return

 ---

This is not a bug but a design error in both AT&T ratfor and this
public domain ratfor.

The problem is with the switch statment.
It switches on an integer valued expression.
It should switch on an integer variable.

The reason is that
    "implicit undefined"
    "implicit null"
is unusable because the switch is done on a new variable that
is not declared or declarable by the programmer who cannot guess
its name.
